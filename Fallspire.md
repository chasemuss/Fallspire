When thinking about your characters backstory, Fallspire (The land you will be doing this campaign in), is a decent sized Island Country. You will pick to enter the island in either Bonewall, a fishing village, which is where the action will actually start; or Ewol, a giant port town that has boats coming from all over the world, bringing people to Fallspire to enjoy all the country has to offer. From here your character will either be traveling from the location you arrived at, to head to Basinwharf, to compete or watch a massive fighting tournament; head to the traveling tour of ancient text at Sandscar, which is home of the Fallspire Accademy; or to witness the wedding of Duchess Wenefreda and the Duke of Fallspire who is the patron of many temples and the Arts.  
Some of you may also, after attending the reason for your travel, might also have a secondary want to vist the mountains of Slukdug, or even the inland fishing of Misthaven.
