# Paid Setup (encouraged)
If you enjoy Obsidian and want to contribute to them, I recommend a [sync account](https://obsidian.md/sync). It is $4 / month and I can share this repository directly with you, without having to go through Git like above. I will update Git so long as one of us is not doing this, so do not feel pressured to pay for this service.
