# Lenore Silverwood

## Hometown
Embris is a prosperous port city of commerce and culture and is the land of Thalaythia’s connection to the rest of the world. Embris sits at the mouth of the Emerald River, where it meets the vast expanse of the sea.

At the heart of Embris lies the Grand Bazaar, a sprawling marketplace where merchants converge to trade their wares. Exotic spices, fine fabrics, and rare artifacts fill the stalls, their colors and scents mingling in the air. Street performers entertain the crowds with music and acrobatics, adding to the vibrant atmosphere.

Embris’ harbor is a sight to behold, filled with ships of all shapes and sizes. From sleek trading vessels to majestic galleons, the harbor is a testament to the city's thriving maritime trade.

The Silverwood family are prominent merchants of Embris, whose wealth and influence span generations. They specialize in the trade of Thalaythian goods like silk, silver, a rare purple dye, and other ‘luxury’ items with other countries. 


### Notes

Lenore is the second child and only daughter of the Silverwood family. Raised in the opulent surroundings of her family's estate, Lenore was groomed from birth for high society. In the wealthy circles of Embris, she was known for her refined demeanor, always appearing poised and composed. Despite her privileged upbringing, Leon Silverwood’s emphasis on education ensured that Lenore was more than a pretty face. She is well-educated, having received tutoring in literature, mathematics, and economics. Lenore is also a skilled conversationalist, adept at charming even the most skeptical of acquaintances. Lenore's beauty and intelligence made her a sought-after match among the city's eligible bachelors, but she remained selective with her suitors. 

Lenore’s father had always been a patron of academic endeavors. He sponsored several archaeological exhibitions, looking for the hidden history of the world. One project he aided in was the uncovering of an ancient castle, crumpled into ruins and buried below hundreds of years of soil and decay. The castle was rumored to be the home of a long dead aristocrat, the details of their lives and demise lost to time. It had taken many months of moving rubble and clearing debris, but the presumed main hall of the ancient castle had been found. Clearly, something heinous had taken place there, long ago. Skeletons surrounded a great table, the petrified remains of a grand feast before them. At the head of the table, a bony hand gripped a necklace, the many onyx and diamonds shining with an almost unnatural glow. The necklace, along with other treasures, were sent to the Silverwood home for inspection from the discovery’s sponsor. Leon was most impressed by the necklace, a spectacular find amidst the others. He had it carefully placed in a glass case on a bed of satin, to keep it from harm until its obviously magical properties could be identified.   

Lenore was visiting her father’s office, hoping to take him out for lunch at his favorite inn near the port, when the necklace caught her eye. The jewels glittered enticingly behind the glass, and Lenore felt an intense urge to touch it. She carefully opened the door, and touched the centerpiece jewel, a gem so black it seemed to swallow light instead of reflecting it. As her finger traced its delicate shape, a thought slid into her mind, almost as if the necklace itself was proposing it to her. Put me on. Tighten the clasp. Leaving me here would be a crime, I was made to be worn by you. 

Lenore lifted the necklace to her neck and clicked the clasp into place behind her hair. Suddenly a chilling sensation swept over her like an unexpected gust of winter wind. It felt as though icy fingers were crawling up her spine, and wrapping themselves around her throat. With each passing moment, the cold seemed to deepen, wrapping around her like a suffocating cloak. Lenore reached for the clasp. Her worry turned to panic when she realized she could no longer feel the hook. It was gone. Her head became filled with a crazed laughter, like someone had infiltrated her very mind. Lenore held her head in her hands and fell to the floor as the world around her began to blur and tilt. Colors faded, sounds muffled, and her vision was filled with darkness. 

When Leon returned to his office, he found his daughter unresponsive. All the color had vanished from her face, and she was freezing to the touch. A shock of white hair mingled in with her dark curls. On the floor around her were the scattered pieces of the necklace. The strange, unnatural shimmer that had made it so mysterious was gone. Leon at first believed she was dead, until he pulled her into his arms and was able to make out the barely perceivable rise and fall of her chest. He carried his daughter out to the carriage, and told his driver to take them to the nearest temple.

Lenore remained comatose for days. Healers and clerics were brought to the Silverwood home, but could not identify the ailment Lenore was suffering from. Lenore’s parents stayed by her bed for days at a time, barely eating and refusing rest. 

After almost a full week, Lenore’s eyes finally opened. Her parents were overjoyed that she was alive, but were still extremely concerned. They asked her what had happened on that day in the office, but she could not remember. Lenore could  only recall vague memories of a shadowy figure and being trapped in the dark.

For the first few days, was confined to her room, but soon began to try to resume her normal life. After all, she felt…fine. Actually, better than fine. Like something in her had been awakened. 

As the days went by, Lenore realized she could now use magic. It was like memories of how to harness a dark force had been placed into her mind, transplanted from somewhere else. Before the incident, Lenore had had no such gift. The only mage in their family had been her younger brother, Lucien, who seemed to be born with magic. She practiced late at night, not wanting to worry her parents. On nights that she spent several hours practicing, she could swear she heard whispering, so quiet it was almost imperceivable, always right behind her. 

Lenore eventually wished to attend parties and social gatherings like she had before the incident. Her mother was hesitant at first, still concerned for Lenore’s well being. While she seemed healthy, there was definitely something..different about her that Seraphina could not put her finger on. In order to protect her daughter, she had completely stopped hosting events at the Silverwood estate. After much debate, Seraphina agreed. She accompanied Lenore to her first few balls and gatherings, explaining her daughter’s changed appearance as a chronic illness to those that asked. Lenore was required to severely limit her attendance, only able to ‘muster the strength’ to attend the most important of soirees.  

It has been almost a full year since the incident. Leon Silverwood has been away on a long voyage. He has given over temporary control of the trading business to Adrian. Lucien Silverwood is away at a school for sorcery. Lenore continues to practice her magic, making excuses to leave the estate to practice in secret. 

### Origin of Powers:
The master of the ancient castle was a cruel archmage who ruled over his land and people with an iron fist. He was consumed with the need to gain more power, turning to evil magic to attain it. During his life, he made contact with a powerful shadow dragon, Vespera, whose greed for power matched the mage.The dragon had become stranded in the plane, unable to cross between. The two forged a plan. The archmage would conduct a ritual to free Vespera from the Shadowfell and gain knowledge and power from the creature, and together they would amass an army and control all of Thalaythia. The dragon gave the mage the ritual instructions, a reversal of what had trapped her in the plane long ago. The Archmage, however, was not willing to share. He tampered with the ritual so that the Vespera’s soul would cross over without a form, and be siphoned into an awaiting vessel. The mage would then be able to harness the dragon’s immense power without fear of betrayal. The vessel the mage chose was a dark gem, infused with shadow magic and placed on a beautiful necklace of diamonds and onyx. The mage had fallen in love with the dragon in his own twisted way, and wanted her prison to be as beautiful as she. 

On the day the ritual was to be performed, the archmage held a grand feast for his acolytes and advisors alike. The ritual began, and Vespera fell for the mage’s betrayal. But, in a final act of revenge, the dragon released all her power as she crossed the planes, causing a devastating surge of dark magic. All who attended were killed in an instant, and the castle crumbled around them and was swallowed up by the earth. With her power spent, and with no physical form, the dragon was trapped, buried under the rubble. 

Hundreds of years passed by, and the necklace was eventually uncovered by the adventurers sponsored by the Silverwood family. The necklace was sent to Embris, where the dragon’s conscience awoke after centuries of sleep. A young woman entered the room, and the dragon could sense a kernel of power in her, a place where she could reside and be free from her onyx cell. The dragon knew that it lacked the strength to assume control of the body, but a vessel that could move freely was far more attractive than an eternity in a jewel. The dragon called out to the human’s mind, and when she slipped the necklace on, the dragon’s life force merged with the woman’s, freeing her from the necklace once and for all.**
