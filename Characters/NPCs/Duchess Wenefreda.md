# Duchess Wenefreda

## Notes
Thought by [[Stanvag Morninghorn]] to be putting on sham weddings. In [[Session 0]], we learned that the man encased in stone is not the Duke, but his twin brother. The twin and Wenefreda have been traveling Fallspire, putting on sham weddings to attract more money into the kingdom from other countries' gifts and stimulate the economy. 


## Relationships
- Is married to [[The Duke of Fallspire]]
