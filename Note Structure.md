# New Note
Each note is created in the main folder (known as Root). When you make a new note, decide if it is a location or a person. Place it in the best folder for it, then perform the following steps:
1) Open Command Palette `cmd + P`
2) Select `Templater: Open Insert Template Model` (you can start typing it and it will filter down to this)
3) Select the right template
4) For Locations, put your cursor under `Events`, and for characters, put your cursor under `Notes`
5) Follow the steps found [[Note Structure#Session Notes|here]]

# Session Notes
1) Find the relevant note (most likely a location, but if we find out information about an NPC, go to their page)
2) Put your cursor after all the other session notes, and follow steps 1-3 from above, selecting `Session Notes` as your template type.
