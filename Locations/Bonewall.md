Wedding of [[Duchess Wenefreda]] & [[The Duke of Fallspire]]

The troupe Caelum & I are travelling with stop at near a tavern for the night and we stay there, promising to join up with them before they leave at first light. 

As Caelum & I walk through the town towards the tavern, an ear-piercing screech & scream is heard and all the citizens sprint for their homes.  We meet up with Lornore & Conras, determining whether or not to go investigate. As we look towards where the sound came from, we see 2 halflings staring at a large block of stone. We walk around the block and see a human male, ecased in the stone (a la Han Solo in Carbonite). It's the Duke. One of the Halflings says he's the mayor of the city, his name Tomerand Fleetfood. 

Lenore mentions to him her name, and Fleetfood mentions she has the dress for the Duchess. Lenore tells Fleetfood that she wishes to hand-deliver the dress. 

I go to investigate the stone and learn that there is some dark magic involved. 

The mayor says that a fog came from a dense forest and that's what caused him to turn to stone. When asked why everyone scrambled to their towns, he answers that fog and stone don't typically affect the royalty. Typically fog just causes individuals to disappear. The mayor says that if someone isn't indoors when the fog comes they are gone. He says that most who explore the forest don't come back. 

There is image on the side where the duke's feet are. At the bottom of the image is script that is in Infernal.

We make our way to the town hall and see runes (*Forbiddance Enforced* in Celestial) on top of the door, and it is locked. The female Halfling that ran away says from inside to hand the dress to the tavern owner, but Lenore says "no" 

We walk into the tavern, meeting with the owner, the barmaid, and seeing that the upstairs is roped off. 

Caelum & I sit next to some elves speaking elvish. They are talking about Sandscar and what they want to read. Elfir, of the elves, mentions his love of ancient languages. 

The barman calls us over and asks for the transcription I took. He then asks if the moon was red, and we reply with no, it was grey. Stanvag says that the script reads "Bloodfang"

Bloodfang is apparently a garrison of soldiers in the north. It's a castle as well. He left that castle 20-25 years ago. 

[[Castle Bloodfang]] is a 5-6 day trip north of Bonewall.  

Roseman Botham is the female Halfling we met earlier whose husband went to Castle Bloodfang, but hasn't come back. 

Stanvag says that the Duchess isn't here. He also doesn't show much faith in the wedding. He says that Jamie, one of the Duke's brothers, may be the one encased in stone. 

The elves go through the roped off stairs to the upstairs. 

We follow after them, seeing a series of gambling rooms. I lose 2 GP

Stanvag comes up and asks if we are heading north. He says to travel during the day time and to stay in the towns along the way. 

Conras says that the duke has been married for 2 years, and that this wedding is for the Duke's twin brother. 

The Duke's brother is a stand-in for the Duke during these sham weddings that are being put on throughout the country to generate revenue for the various cities. 

Stanvag tells us how to get to Castle Bloodfang safely
- Travel to Lavendale and find Tobias Hearthstone & tell him about the wolf, but not the script
- Travel to Misthaven, and ask for Magnus. He'll give us a place for the night
- Travel to Oakvale, and the woodworkers may help us. Also talk to Miracle
- Finally, the Bloodfang outpost. They will tell us how to approach the Castle. Mention Stanvag and they should be able to assist us. 

He then opens the door that the end of the hall and let's us into the Inn nextdoor.

We get a suite for the night and discuss what our plans are

As we dream, we hear a voice say "The Moon will stop for No One"
