## Notes
I used to be an adventurous boy, running through the forest near Mistwood Hollow. Although I had heard the others talk about The Hollow’s Heart, some creature that wandered the woods, I didn’t believe them. I was carefree (and a bit careless), climbing trees and talking with the animals he found. Once, I even came across an almiraj hole, chasing after them in a playful manner. On a fateful day, when the sun was able to pierce the canopy of the forest, I found a portal in the trunk of a large tree. Venturing into it, thinking “I’ll just pop my head in and see what’s through here”, little did I know that I would be teleported to the feywild. 

I wandered through the feywild, searching for a way home. Along the way, I met many fantastical creatures. They were always trying to pull a fast one on me, asking for my name and such, but I was careful with my wording since my mother had told me all sorts of stories about them. As I spent more time there, I made a home for myself among the fey, and while I was never considered one of them, they tolerated me and allowed me to live in peace. I never stopped looking for a way out, and several of them assisted me when they were mad at me and wanted me gone. 

Once again, fate / luck / whatever shined upon me and allowed me to go back home. By this time, the fey had taught me how to fight, and I had been imbued with some of their enchantment magic. The archfey of the domain, [Ryvon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/3852140-high-fae-noble), gave me a magical bean with the instructions that if I ever needed his help, consume it and his power would be lent to me, growing as I developed them.
