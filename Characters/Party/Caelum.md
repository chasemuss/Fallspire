# Caelum

## Notes

In the heart of the Summer Court of the Feywild, there lived a fairy known as Caelum. Unlike his kin, who tended to the blooming groves and tranquil streams, Caelum was drawn to the untamed force of fire. He was born during a rare celestial alignment, under the Red Moon’s Eclipse, which bathed him in a fiery glow and marked him as the chosen Wildfire Druid of his generation.

Caelum’s wings shimmered with a spectrum of warm colors, from the soft orange of a candle’s flame to the deep red of burning coals. His hair was like strands of gold, reflecting the sunlight during the day and mirroring the firelight at night. His eyes held the spark of curiosity and the steady burn of determination.

As a child, Caelum discovered his unique affinity for fire when he accidentally ignited a fallen log with a mere touch. The Elders of the Summer Court, both intrigued and concerned, decided to mentor him in the ways of the Druidic Order. They taught him to harness the destructive power of fire and use it to rejuvenate the forest, turning ash into fertile ground for new life.

In the twilight of the Feywild, Caelum prepares for a journey beyond the familiar. His silhouette flickers like a flame against the ancient trees, wings glistening with the last touch of the realm’s eternal dusk. The bond with his wildfire spirit, an ever-present ember in his heart, whispers of undiscovered realms and the secrets they hold. It is a bond that cannot be ignored, a call to explore the full spectrum of their fiery magic.

He carries the warmth of the Feywild within, a gift from the wildfire spirit that has chosen him. This spirit, a living embodiment of fire’s dual nature, urges Caelum to witness the rebirth that follows destruction, to understand the delicate balance their powers can bring to worlds where such equilibrium is not known.

As he steps through the veil between worlds, a powerful fey entity watches, its eyes reflecting the druid’s inner light. This entity, ancient and wise, has seen the need for the druid’s unique skills in the lands beyond. It has tasked him with a mission of great importance, one that could shape the destiny of more than just the Feywild.

With a heart undaunted and steadfast, Caelum commences his legendary odyssey. He parts from the timeless splendor of his abode, bearing the vow of his return, the aspiration for enlightenment, and the promise to harness his burgeoning might for the beneficence of all kingdoms. On this monumental journey, he is accompanied by Godwyn, a gallant human Paladin whose destiny was reshaped within the enigmatic bounds of the Feywild. Under the esteemed guidance of the Summer Court, Godwyn’s prowess has been finely honed. United, they recognize the formidable voyage that lies before them, fraught with innumerable challenges. Nevertheless, Caelum remains unshaken, driven by a profound desire to realize his destiny and to explore the vast expanse of his mystical talents.
